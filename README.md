## Compiling the app
Before anything, be sure to have a working flutter sdk setup.If not installed, go to [Install - Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

Be sure to disable signing on build.gradle or change keystore to sign the app.

For now the required flutter channel is master, so issue those two commands before starting building:
```
flutter channel master
```
```
flutter upgrade
```

After that, building is simple as this:
```
flutter pub get
```
```
flutter run
```
```
flutter build platform-name
```
